Mastermind.java and Driver.java are the files that the Mastermind game is based off of. One runs Driver.java in the command line in order to begin the game. The idea behind this project is to have the computer play the role of the code breaker in the game Mastermind. The game begins by having the player first select the desired amount of colors and the desired length of the game code. The player then writes out his/her desired combination. The computer then proceeds to provide guesses for the player and the player must respond to how many colors are correct and are in the right and wrong position. The computer takes this feedback and analyzes it by first generating all the possible codes there are given the amount of colors and the max length of the code, and then compares all the choices to the guess. If the guess and the possible code do not produce the same number of colors correct in the right and wrong position, that possible code is removed from the possible code list. The computer then repeats these steps until it finds the correct answer.
