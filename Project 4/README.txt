I decided to use a Node class with respective variables to help during the Dijikstra algorithm, an Edge class that is the edges between the Nodes, a Graph class that houses all the relative functions that this project needed, and a Driver class that runs the files for the project. Notable obstacles I encountered were memory limitation, optimizing runtime algorithms, and lack of time.
